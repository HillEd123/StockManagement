#Medication Stock Keeping System

#Introduction

A stock management system should manage the process for managing and locating objects. In this example, you will create a stock management system for medication in rural clinics in Africa. There are three types of medication:

    NEVIRAPINE
    STAVUDINE
    ZIDOTABINE

There are 10 different clinics, spread across different countries. You can name them Clinic A, Clinic B, or alternative names if you wish.

#Requirements

    To create a minimal stock management system to update and retrieve stock levels of the different medications at each respective clinics.
    There must be a way to retrieve a separate listing of the clinics that are low on medication (less than 5 items).
    All clinics must have at least 5 items of each medication at all times, otherwise there must be a warning displayed (e.g "Clinic A is low on NEVIRAPINE")

#Constraints There must still be some kind of user interface, so that the program can be tested. The main emphasis is however on the backend functionality and database. You can use any technology you wish, preferably the one of you are most comfortable with. All data must be persistently stored.
